# Obsidian Reference Generator
This plugin will quickly generate harvard references from links.
**HOWEVER** this plugin is still in development. I'm not entirely sure if I'll be capable of making this and if I can't then this repository will go private.

## My Goal
I am trying to develop a plugin that lets you select a link or multiple links and quickly replace them with generated harvard referencers.
To achieve this I will have to web scrape and make sure I do this ethically and legally.

Feel free to watch the development, or come back later if this plugin interests you.
