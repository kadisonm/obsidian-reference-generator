## This plugin offers:
- Generating references for multiple links in one selection
- Over 2000 styles to choose from
- A variety of customisation and settings

## Installation
- Download the [latest release](https://github.com/kadisonm/obsidian-reference-generator/releases) and manually add the `main.js`, `manifest.json`, `styles.css` assets to `your-vault\.obsidian\plugins\reference-generator`

## Network usage
This plugins requires internet access for the following:
- To gather data such as authors, title and more, a request must be made to the selected website.
- To use citation styles and locales, a request for a CSL file must be made from the [Citation Style Language - Style Repository](https://github.com/citation-style-language/styles) and the [Citation Style Language - Locales Repository](https://github.com/citation-style-language/locales) for an XML file on every generation.

## How to use
### Default styling
A default citation style can be selected for generation in the plugin settings. This allows you to generate references without having to select it each time.

### Generating a reference
Select a link and right click to open the context menu. This will display to generation options, allowing you to either select a style or use your default. Alternatively, a command can be used from the command bar.

### Generating multiple references at a time
Select multiple links, right click and follow the same steps for generating a reference. This will take more time depending on how many links you are generating.
